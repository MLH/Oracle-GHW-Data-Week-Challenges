# Coding Challenges

## Coding Challenge 1 
### Ad Mastery Challenge: Develop Dynamic Ad Message API
#### Objective: 
* Get ready to revolutionize the application's advertising game! Join the Ad Mastery Challenge to build a dynamic ad messages API and integrate it into the application's interface.
* In this challenge, discover how Oracle makes it easier to build and deploy cloud-native applications in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
* Learn how to effortlessly develop applications using the code editor in OCI, and then deploy them using Kubernetes.
* And since every app needs a database, why not leverage Oracleâ€™s managed MySQL HeatWave Database to simplify deployment and management tasks?.
* Head over to [this workshop](https://hackp.ac/ghwapi24-oracle-ad-mastery-challenge) for step by step guidance on how to complete this challenge! 

## Coding Challenge 2 
### The Solar Eclipse Challenge
#### Objective: 
* Identify the best places in the North Eastern US to host a solar eclipse viewing party
  * Build an application using APEX showing the cities closest to the solar eclipse path of totality. _As a bonus generate a map to visualize your results._
  * Given the provided datasets, load the datasets to the database and write queries to find the following:
    * Find all US cities with a population > 10,000 that are within 10 miles of the center line representing the path of the total eclipse over the course of the day
    * Find the cities in the states Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine (VT, NH, ME) with a population greater than 5000 and which are less than 50 miles from the center.
    * Add the GEOM column to the query above
  * Display the results of these queries in your Apex application
  * Sign up for an account with OpenWeatherMap and use the 5 day/ 3 hour API to provide weather predictions for your chosen location
    * Set up a REST data source using the OpenWeatherMap and use the API provided to display weather predictions for given lat/lon
  * Identify which cities in Northeastern US are closest to the path of totality, taking into account the weather conditions, and make a recommendation on where to host a viewing party.
    * The recommendation should include a description as to why the recommendation was made.
* BONUS:
  * Create a map visualizing the US with the path of the solar eclipse. Add all the cities in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont (OH, PA, NY, VT) with a population greater than 10,000

## Coding Challenge 3 
### Build a RESTful ORDS API!
#### Objectives: 
* Learn how to create a REST service using Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) on an Autonomous Database.
* You will start by creating an application user whom you will use throughout all the lab steps.
* Once created, we will load data and create a table in our database.
* Using the same UI, we will REST enable that table so that endpoints created for all major operations (create, update, query, delete). Lastly, we will use OAuth to secure the REST service endpoints.
* This challenge can be completed entirely from the Database Actions UI that is provided with all Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) installs and with the Autonomous Database in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

#### Documentation:
* [This live lab features step by step instructions on how to complete this challenge](https://hackp.ac/ghwapi24-oracle-ords-api)!

## Coding Challenge 4 
### Build an AI-Powered Online Book Store app using Oracle APEX!
#### Objectives: 
* In this challenge, you'll dive into the world of books by creating an exciting Online Bookstore App using Oracle APEX.
* With AI and smooth API connections, you'll build a smart platform where users can search for books and receive personalized recommendations based on their reading preferences.
* You'll gain practical skills in Oracle APEX, as well as integration of AI and REST APIs while exploring how technology can enhance the experience of online book shopping.

#### Documentation:
* [You can use this workshop as reference for completing this challenge](https://hackp.ac/ghwapi24-oracle-book-store-challenge)!
  * Note: Instead of Lab 1: For creating Rest Data Source, use this [API](https://hackp.ac/ghwapi24-oracle-challenge4-api).
