# Coding Challenges

## Coding Challenge 1 
### Explore Operational Property Graphs with Oracle Database 23ai
#### Objective: 
* This workshop focuses on working with Property Graphs in Oracle Database 23ai. You will create a graph from two tables, one containing bank account information, and another containing bank transactions information. You will then run graph pattern queries in SQL on this graph. You will find circular payment chains, multi-hop paths between accounts, and more.
* In Oracle Database 23ai, the GRAPH_TABLE function and MATCH clause of the new SQL:2023 standard enable you to write simple SQL queries to follow connections in data. This workshop illustrates how you can model your data as a graph and run graph queries in SQL to quickly see relationships in your data that are difficult to identify otherwise.
* Head over to [this workshop](https://hackp.ac/ghwdata24-oracle-OPG) for step by step guidance on how to complete this challenge! 

## Coding Challenge 2 
### Learn the basics of SQL
#### Objective: 
* This challenge will provide an introduction to the Structured Query Language (SQL), learn how to create tables with primary keys, columns, constraints, indexes, and foreign keys.

#### Documentation:

## Coding Challenge 3 
### Use SQL for relational tables and JSON documents in a single database
#### Objectives: 
* JSON Relational Duality is a landmark capability in Oracle Database 23ai providing game-changing flexibility and simplicity for Oracle Database developers. This breakthrough innovation overcomes the historical challenges developers have faced when building applications, using relational or document models. JSON Relational Duality converges the benefits of the Relational and Document worlds within a single database. Apps can access the same data as a set of JSON documents or as relational tables and columns without data duplication. Whether you are a Relational/SQL developer, Document database developer, Java or Python App developer, gain first-hand experience building apps using Duality Views.

## Coding Challenge 4 
### Data Grand Slam Challenge: Hitting Home Runs with Insights!
#### Objectives: 
* Welcome to the Data Grand Slam Challenge! Are you ready to showcase your expertise in data management and analytics? _Join us in this challenge where you'll tackle three key tasks_:
 * MySQL HeatWave Database Creation: Your first challenge is to set up a MySQL HeatWave Database Service to serve as your data warehouse. This will be the cornerstone of your data infrastructure.
 * OCI Data Integration to Build Data Pipeline: Next, utilize OCI Data Integration, a powerful, fully managed, serverless, native cloud service, to construct a robust data pipeline. Your mission is to ingest data from diverse sources, perform necessary cleansing, transformations, and reshaping, and efficiently load it into your MySQL HeatWave Database Service.
 * OCI Data Science: Once your data pipeline is up and running, it's time to leverage the analytical prowess of OCI Data Science and MySQL HeatWave. Dive into the data, analyze it with precision, and derive insights at lightning speed. Uncover hidden patterns, trends, and correlations that will impress even the most discerning data enthusiasts.

_Join us in this challenge to push the boundaries of data management and analytics. Are you up for the challenge?_
